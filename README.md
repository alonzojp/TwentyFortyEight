# TwentyFortyEight

## Summary
2048 is a widely popular flash game that was created a few years ago. For fun, I decided to try and recreate the game from scratch!

### How it Works:
Simply boot the game up and play! Numbers can either move up, down, left, or right, and the end goal is to create the number TwentyFortyEight! Good luck!
